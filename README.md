# X-ray AI: Detecting Knee Abnormalities with Deep Learning
AI tool to detect abnormalities in X-rays such as osteoarthritis. 
The motivation behind this work is personal: after experiencing knee problems from long hours working as a 
cook, and going through multiple misdiagnoses and long hospital waits, I realized how critical accurate and 
efficient medical imaging analysis can be. This project is my step toward applying AI to healthcare challenges.

So far:
- Image preprocessing and augmentation
- Binary classification using CNN and ResNet50
- Train/validation split with reproducibility


Coming:
- Evaluation metrics: accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC curve
- Visualization of sample X-rays and training performance
